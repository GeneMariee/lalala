        <h2>Deep down in the galaxy, outside the solar system, stars are everywhere, though there are many different types and kinds of them it is still appealing to learn about it. It comprises a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its gravity. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. 
 
            Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. Turbulence deep within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. Not to ruin your childhood song, but stars do not twinkle rather, it's a result of how we see them from our perspective on Earth. Because stars are so far away, we see them as tiny points of light in the night sky.
          
            These luminous balls of gas helped ancient explorers navigate the seas and now help modern-day scientists navigate the universe. Stars look beautiful but boy they're ten times hottr than the sun. You might have thought the red one's are hotter than the blue one.

  <p>One idea is to simply define a planet as a natural object in space that is massive enough for gravity to make it approximately spherical. But some scientists objected that this simple definition does not take into account what degree of measurable roundness is needed for an object to be considered round. In fact, it is often difficult to accurately determine the shapes of some distant objects. Others argue that where an object is located or what it is made of do matter and there should not be a concern with dynamics; that is, whether or not an object sweeps up or scatters away its immediate neighbors, or holds them in stable orbits. The lively planethood debate continues. As our knowledge deepens and expands, the more complex and intriguing the universe appears. Researchers have found hundreds of extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, that reside outside our solar system; there may be billions of exoplanets in the Milky Way Galaxy alone, and some may be habitable (have conditions favorable to life). Whether our definitions of planet can be applied to these newly found objects remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>Now, let's talk about planets. A planet is a celestial body that is in orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and  has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. Planets are not just inside the solar system, there are also hundreds of planets the scientists, NASA and astronomers discovered that is outside the solar system. To the unaided eye, these planets appear starlike. However, the planets moved relative to the stars. For this reason they were called wandering stars. Our word "planet" comes from the Greek word planetes, meaning "wanderer."

<p>So much for that, let me introduce you to some of the planets out side the solar system.
