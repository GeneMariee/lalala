     <p>Nibiru is a ghost planet. Author Zecharia Sitchin claimed in The 12th Planet (1976) that ancient Sumerian texts revealed the existence of a planet called Nibiru, which circles the Sun every 3,600 years on a long 
        elliptical orbit like a comet and passes between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter at its perihelion.The Nibiru cataclysm is a supposed disastrous encounter between Earth and a large planetary object  that certain groups believed would take place in the early 21st century.</p>

        
         <p>Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Nibiru or Planet X. Nibiru has been linked to NASA by various bloggers. Because of this claimed connection, space agency officials put out a statement saying that no big planet was coming to destroy Earth in 2012. What follows
             below is the true science and history of this supposed rogue planet, with reference to a real object, Comet Elenin, that somehow got mixed up in the whole mess.</p>
             <p>This ghost planet is also called as Planet X. It is nonexistent, it is calld a ghost planet for even scientists do not know what it looks like.
                They've only seen the size, but they do not recognize it fully since it is very far away and the astronomic telescope cannot zoom in that far. </p>
